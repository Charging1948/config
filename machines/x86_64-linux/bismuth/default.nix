# @TODO(jakehamilton): Move this to my Logseq notes.
# Wine Shenanigans (to run Cave Story):
# 1. Install Lutris and select the game "Final Fantasy XIV Online" to install.
# 2. Proceed with the installer until it wants to install the game and then click cancel.
# 3. Finish with the Lutris installer and open a terminal. Run the following:
#   WINEPREFIX=/home/short/Games/final-fantasy-xiv-online wine64 ../Cave\ Story\ Multiplayer/Doukutsu.exe
# 4. The `final-fantasy-xiv-online` directory can be renamed/moved, or have its contents copied.
#   to the default Wine prefix if preferred.
# **NOTE**: wine-wow (wine64) is required to run in this prefix, so the package `wine64Packages.unstable`
#   should be installed.
